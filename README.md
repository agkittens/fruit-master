# fruit-master
game like fruit ninja made in go

## Description
The application being developed aims to test the psychomotor skills of the user. To conduct the test, the user will participate in an arcade game where their proficiency will be assessed based on their achieved score. The user must actively distinguish between elements they need to interact with and elements they must avoid. The time element of the game involves a time limit within which the user can interact with objects on the screen. Additionally, sound effects will indicate the current mode of the game.

## Gameplay
After the game starts, the user must "cut" thrown fruits. The fruits will have simulated gravity. Each fruit caught gives the player one point. When the music stops, each fruit subtracts one point. Additionally, to increase the difficulty of the game, other objects - skulls - will appear randomly. Each time a skull is hit, it decreases the player's life.
